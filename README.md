# Personal-Blog

Blogging Website that supports updating status, writing blogs & articles 
with added facility of importing images, music & video frames. Keep track
of tasks in hand with the "to-do list" and "Remainder". Also forget nothing with
the help of "sticky notes".  

Great UI/UX with Responsive Layout allowing its use in PCs, Tabs and Mobiles.
